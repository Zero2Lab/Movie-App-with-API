# Fourth Project - Movie App with tmdb APIs

The Movie App is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to browse, search, and get detailed information about movies. Users can view movies under three main categories: Now Showing, Upcoming, and Popular. The app features a user-friendly interface and utilizes three different TMDB (The Movie Database) APIs to fetch movie data.

## Features

- **Now Showing Movies**: Browse movies that are currently showing in theaters.
- **Upcoming Movies**: Discover movies that are scheduled to be released soon.
- **Popular Movies**: Check out the most popular movies among viewers.
